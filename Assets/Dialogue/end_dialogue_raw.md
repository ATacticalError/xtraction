Silas: Finally, it is mine.
Footsteps can be heard in the distance…
The Freedom Fighters have realised not long ago that three components have gone missing. 
They determine that Silas is at the final component.
*Running*
Nova and Jagger appear in front of Silas. In full flesh.
Silas: You’re all too late. Along with the other Freedom Fighters.
Silas: Finally sick of those drones?
Jagger: You think you can take-
Nova: Silas listen.
Jagger: …
Nova: It doesn't have to be this way.
Silas: Yes, it does. This is the only way.
Nova appears quite distraught
Jagger: We won’t let you get away with this!
Silas: I already have.
With the power of the nullifying ring and the bolting rod to power it, Silas begins the extraction of the manor book with the help of the blue orb. 


Nova: …
Jagger begins to rush towards Silas
Nova: …
He is then stopped by Nova
A force field begins to circle around the weapon.
Nova: You know they sealed the book for a reason.
Silas: They sealed it because they didn't trust in humanity.
Nova: They sealed it, so it doesn’t land in the wrong hands.
Silas: Well, it’s in the right hands now. 
The ultimate power…
It’s mine…
Mine…
Nova begins to panic
Nova: The curse! You don't know what the curse can do. 
Silas: I have the ultimate power, I’ll reverse the curse
Nova: That’s not how it works! A curse is a curse. It can’t be reversed like that.
Jagger: Who cares about the curse right now!? Silas is the problem, who knows what he would do when the ultimate power is his.
As the extraction proceeds, Silas grows more powerful. 
Jagger: Nova!?! Are we really going to just let him stand there and get what he wants?
Nova: …
Silas: wait-
Flashbacks from the ancient cult start circling within Silas’ mind.
Silas: but-

Nova looks towards Jagger and all the other Freedom Fighters
Nova: Listen all… We must stand down. Silas will not obtain the ultimate power.
Jagger: How can you say that when it’s currently extracting now?!?
Nova: You’re right he is currently extracting the manor book.
Yet there’s nothing we can do to stop the extraction once it begins.
Jagger: Well, we can’t just stand and watch!
Nova: Yes, we can.
Jagger: …
How can you say that…?
Nova: Because of the curse.
Jagger: How do you know so much about the curse?
Nova: …
I just do
With the extraction almost complete, Silas begins to harness some power...
And the memories of the ancient cult...
Bloodlines…
Silas: …
You're a descendant of the cult leader?!?
Nova: …
Jagger: …...?
Nova: ….
Nova: Yes.
Jagger: but-
Nova: That's that
That doesn't make me any different from you
We’re the same
We’re both leaders, we have the same goals 
Silas: …
Silas: I’m going to die…

Nova: And die you will
Jagger: I don’t understand…
Silas: And so, will you.
Nova: That’s right.
Jagger: …
Nova...?
…
Nova... can you just explain to me what’s going on?!?
Silas: No… I was so close…
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If I just get the ultimate power….
I can still reverse-
Nova: Stop. 
I’ve accepted my fate and so should you.
Silas slowly crouches on the floor
He sits…
Hugging his legs…
Silas: …
Nova looks towards Jagger
Nova: A descendant’s job is to protect the manor book from being extracted. 
Jagger: …
Nova: There can only be one descendant alive at a time…
And yet I have failed. 
Jagger: …
I’ve known you for ten years.
I thought I really knew everything about you… 
…
What happens now…?
Nova: My bloodline dies.
Along with the successful extractor. 
The force field closes crushing them.
That’s the curse.
Jagger: …
Nova: I guess it’s like a punishment for not doing my job correctly. Heh, funny right?
We said our one job is to protect all of humanity…
Especially our people.
The extraction completes 

The blinding light within the force field fades away revealing a broken Silas on the floor crying.
Silas: I only wanted to see her again…
My daughter…
The force fields began to close in on Silas
Silas: I wanted the ultimate power to bring her back… and to make all of humanity pay for her suffering. 
As the force field closes, Silas looks up to the sky
Silas: I’m coming Giggles. 
Splat
Nova: …
Jagger: …
Jagger: Will that happen to you…?
Nova: I receive a merciful death.
Jagger: Good…
I don’t think I can see you die like that.
No.
I don’t think I can see you die.
Nova: Don’t go soft on me now.
We always said that we were ready to die. 
Together or not.
Jagger: Not like this.
Nova: …
Hey.
I’m glad I met you.
*nova;s sprite appears with no mask or with mask if Brittney is swamped with other work kek*
I’m glad I was able to be apart of something so special.
I’m glad I was able to lead such an amazing group.
Nova’s hands begin to fade
Jagger: …
Jagger begins to tear…
I’m sorry.
I can’t watch you die.
Jagger runs up to Nova and hugs her. 
He then turns away and quickly dashes.
Nova: …
…
…
After ten years of friendship.
You’d leave me to die alone.
Heh...
Nova fades.
