In order to evolve the world to its stage, you -- 
The brilliant scientist Silas, have been working on inducing a phenomenon known as "Extraction"!
However, after gathering the materials required to complete the "Extraction", 
the four necessary "Components" have been stolen by an unknown enemy!
Infiltrate their base and take back what is yours!

The four Components have been hidden in various places on their base (Swinburne Campus).

You must first collect "Clues" to help lead you to where the Components' are hidden.
Clues are signified by Yellow spheres. Walk up to them to collect the corresponding Clue.

Collecting a Clue will add it into your Inventory.
Inventory is where you can view a Clue for hints pointing towards a Component's location.
<Clue card image>
A Text Clue may give general directions of where a Component is.
Also, finding a Clue will reveal a rough area of a Component will be, but not the exact location!
(Signified by a large Green sphere.)

An Image Clue will reveal the exact location of a Component.
To collect the Component, you must be standing on the point exactly where the Image was taken!
(Components are signified by a small Blue sphere. 
They will not reveal themselves until you have already collected them)

Collect all four Components and you win the game!

The area is guarded by patrolling Drones!
These drones move between Patrol Points
(Patrol Points signified by small red spheres)

Don't get caught in their Detection Radius.
If you are caught in their sights, they'll raise an Alert!
(Detection radius signified by a large red sphere around each Drone)
<Drone Radius>
In alert mode, the Drone will stop, and its Detection Radius will increase.
Make sure you've left the Drone's Detection Radius before the Alert Timer runs out!
If you are caught inside a Radius when the Alert Timer runs out, you've lost the game!

In spite of that, all is not lost.
Every time you collect a Component, you gain one random Ability!
These abilities can help you evade, stop or even destroy Drones or their Patrol Points.
