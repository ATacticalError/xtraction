  clueContent: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI firmly want to apologise for losing the manor book.
    I know you\u2019ve said that it\u2019s okay but I feel irresponsible for overlooking
    it. My sister was really mad at me that day\u2026 and I can\u2019t believe she
    took such an important item and ran. I have a feeling she\u2019s by the usual
    mural down South-East. Please take a look once you have time, for now I will
    look after my leg so I leave it up to you."
