  clueContent: "I\u2019m hoping this note gets to HQ. After the encounter with Silas,
    we must be more vigilant. Some think that he\u2019ll be back to take the four
    key components again. The Bolting Rod was kept next to the Cheese Grater. If
    you look up, you should also see the glass tunnel."
